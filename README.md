# Weight Tracker Interview Test

Welcome to our Weight Tracker Test! This repository is designed to evaluate your coding skills, particularly in ReactJS. Here, we are interested in how you structure code, manage state, and perhaps also how you approach UI design. Creating a "pretty" web appliaction is not important here, but we do want to see you use some certain packages.

### Tech Stack
- Phase 1
  - ReactJS
  - TailwindCSS
  - TypeScript (JavaScript is also fine, but TypeScript is preferred)
- Phase 2
  - NodeJS
  - Express

## How to submit your code:
We think the easiest way for you to submit your code, is to:
1. `Fork` this repository.
2. `Clone` your fork on your machine locally.
2. Make modifications to your `fork`.
3. Once you are done, `push` your code to your own fork.
4. Notify us so that we can start reviewing your fork! We should be able to see your fork inside `GitHub`.

You may also `compress` (`.zip`) your code and send it back to us.
However we aim to see your `git` knowledge (basics: `clone`, `commit`, `push`)

## Some tips
1. Go through [Phase 1](https://github.com/doshexchnage/weight-tracker-test/blob/dev/PHASE-1.md) and finish it.
2. If you feel comfortable and have enough time, continue to go through [Phase 2](https://github.com/doshexchnage/weight-tracker-test/blob/dev/PHASE-1.md) and finish it.

# Phase 1
Objective:
- Test fundamental React skills, UI component development, and basic server interaction.

[See here for Phase 1 instructions](https://github.com/doshexchnage/weight-tracker-test/blob/dev/PHASE-1.md)

# Phase 2
Objective:
- Evaluate skills in creating RESTful APIs, integrating with databases (if opted for), and enhancing frontend interactions.

[See here for Phase 2 instructions](https://github.com/doshexchnage/weight-tracker-test/blob/dev/PHASE-2.md)

## Good luck with both phases! We are eager to see how you advance this application from a simple static app to one interacting with a backend service! If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
